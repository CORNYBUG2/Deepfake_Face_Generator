# 🧪 Deepfake Face Generator (DCGAN + TensorFlow)

A generative model trained to create realistic human faces from random noise using the Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) architecture. This project approaches Generative AI like real engineering — from training to deployment-readiness.

## 🧠 What It Does

- Generates synthetic human face images from random noise
- Trained using a Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) in TensorFlow
- Produces `.png` images that resemble real human faces
- Saves model weights and generated images across training

---

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- ✅ TensorFlow-based DCGAN implementation
- ✅ Compact generator model: **~19MB**
- ✅ Tracked all training experiments using **MLflow**
- ✅ Automatically saves output samples after each epoch
- ✅ Optimized for training on both CPU and GPU
- ✅ Ready for integration with FastAPI/Streamlit/Gradio for serving
